# Golang Interview Kit

A comprehensive, production-quality collection of data structures and algorithms for technical interviews, implemented in Go with full generic type support.

## 🚀 Features

- **Generic Type Support** - Works with any type using Go 1.21+ generics
- **Memory Efficient** - Optimized implementations with proper capacity management
- **Production Ready** - Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
- **Interview Focused** - Includes common algorithmic patterns and use cases
- **100% Test Coverage** - Extensive test suites with benchmarks
- **Documentation** - Clear API documentation with time complexity notes

## 📦 Data Structures Implemented

### Linear Collections (`collections/`)

#### 1. LinkedList
- **Operations**: Append, Prepend, Insert, Delete, Get, Find
- **Features**: Head/tail pointers for O(1) operations, reverse capability
- **Use Cases**: Dynamic insertion/deletion, when array resizing is expensive

#### 2. Stack 
- **Operations**: Push, Pop, Peek, MultiPush, MultiPop
- **Features**: LIFO behavior, dynamic resizing, capacity optimization
- **Use Cases**: DFS, expression evaluation, backtracking, balanced parentheses

#### 3. Queue
- **Operations**: Enqueue, Dequeue, Front, Rear, MultiEnqueue, MultiDequeue
- **Features**: FIFO behavior, circular buffer implementation, auto-resizing  
- **Use Cases**: BFS, level-order traversal, sliding window, process scheduling

#### 4. Deque (Double-ended Queue) (Coming soon)
- **Operations**: PushFront, PushBack, PopFront, PopBack, Rotate
- **Features**: O(1) operations at both ends, can work as stack or queue
- **Use Cases**: Sliding window maximum, palindrome checking, undo/redo systems
